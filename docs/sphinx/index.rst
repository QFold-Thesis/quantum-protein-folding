Quantum protein folding documentation
=====================================


This repository explores **protein folding** using **quantum computing** approach. 
The implementations are inspired by and extend the methods described in 
`Protein Folding Problem: A Quantum Approach <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02163>`_.

This documentation provides an overview of the project's Python modules, 
explaining their structure and functionality. It guides users through tools for 
building Hamiltonians, computing bead interactions, and simulating protein dynamics. 

The sections below contain detailed references for each module, including 
their main classes, functions, and usage examples.
