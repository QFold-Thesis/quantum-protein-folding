    Represents a protein with main and side chains.

    The main chain is defined as a sequence of amino acid residues, with valid types
    [A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y].
    Side chains are optional and can be empty; if present, they follow the same residue types.
    Side chains cannot be attached to the first or last main bead.

        main_chain (MainChain): The main chain of the protein.
        side_chain (SideChain): The optional side chain of the protein.
